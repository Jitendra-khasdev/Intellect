Compute_Intellectual
======

The aim of this project to cultive coding skill, increase the logical ability 
to understand computing system.

This project contains running code of computer science and engineering respec-
tive subjects eg. c, data structure, algorithm analysis and design, computer-
graphics and multimedia, network and security, and my most fav system programm-
ing etc.

Your are free to use, Implement new algorithm, use our API and built products
More codes on different topics are welcome :-).


The main focus of this project:-

1. Provide a practical approch toward problem.
2. By reading code, increase the coding skill level.
3. High availablity of code.
4. To create a benchmark of code bank by the community.
